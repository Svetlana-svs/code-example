    jcr:description="* Goal: provide the UI for end-user to submit his/her email aka 'email subscription'.
        &#13;User account is not created. User email must be verified by specific email with activation link.
&#13;The data can be stored and validated on the CRM side, or can be stored on the DMP side.
&#13;The emails to user can be sent by CRM or DMP as well.
&#13;When data is stored within DMP, the corresponding admin UI (underground) should be configured
&#13;

&#13;- Data layer type (CRM/DMP)
&#13;- Subscribe options (one or two checkboxes)
&#13;- Number of emails received by user"
